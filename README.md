✨ Air Canvas – Hand Gesture Based Drawing System

A real-time Air Canvas application that allows users to draw in the air using hand gestures, powered by Computer Vision and AI.

This project uses a webcam to track hand landmarks and enables touch-free drawing, board switching, color selection, and erasing — creating an intuitive Human–Computer Interaction (HCI) experience.

🚀 Features

✋ Gesture-based drawing using only your hand

🎨 Multiple color options: Blue, Green, Red, Pink

🧽 Eraser mode

🧹 Clear canvas with gesture

🖥️ Two interactive boards:

Whiteboard

Transparent Board

⚡ Smooth and real-time performance

📷 Fully fullscreen webcam experience

✋ Gesture Controls
